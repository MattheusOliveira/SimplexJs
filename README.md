# SimplexJs
Simplex is an algorithm created by the mathematician George Dantzig that enables the solution of many linear programming problems. Quite popular, it finds good acceptance in areas where diverse needs and constraints influence a value that needs to be increased or decreased to the maximum.  The algorithm can be implemented in several different ways, but the principle is basically the same.  The following implementation was encouraged by my teacher Eduardo Noronha, who taught the Operational Research discipline of the Information Systems course at the Federal Institute of Goi√°s (IFG). The implementation focuses only on problems that aim to maximize solutions.
